["However, while these features encourage safer programming idioms, the type system of C++ is too
weak to enforce its ownership disciplines statically, so it is still easy to write programs with unsafe
or undefined behavior using these features."](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/rustbelt/paper.pdf)

[The model eliminates the possibility of dangling pointers and races, and ensures
memory safety. However, this model also restricts the language’s
expressiveness. Mapping semantics required of a collector implementation
into Rust’s language model was the major challenge that
we faced during the work.](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/downloads/pdf/rust-ismm-2016.pdf)
