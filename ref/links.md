["However, while these features encourage safer programming idioms, the type system of C++ is too
weak to enforce its ownership disciplines statically, so it is still easy to write programs with unsafe
or undefined behavior using these features."](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/rustbelt/paper.pdf)

[The model eliminates the possibility of dangling pointers and races, and ensures
memory safety. However, this model also restricts the language’s
expressiveness. Mapping semantics required of a collector implementation
into Rust’s language model was the major challenge that
we faced during the work.](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/downloads/pdf/rust-ismm-2016.pdf)

[For a class type with pointer data members, there are necessities to overload its default constructor, explicit constructor, copy constructor, destructor and assignment operator to prevent shallow copies, side effects and memory leaks. ](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1360000/1352420/p213-yang.pdf?ip=201.22.186.209&id=1352420&acc=PUBLIC&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E0C5A9160825F9648%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1529871160_621cd8aea6fce2ce03964ee2c1e78c5f)
